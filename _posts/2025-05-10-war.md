War.  

Everyone’s cool with “an eye for an eye” -  
until the eye is theirs.  

I still tell myself,  
"`I won’t become the monster that made me bleed.`”  

But sometimes,  
peace is only possible when it's backed by power.  

Real power.  

The kind that makes your enemies think twice.  

Because the fear of what you could do is often what stops them from doing anything at all. It's why India needs unity, strength, and resolve now more than ever and it's on us to build it.  

It’s not just about having the bigger stick - it’s about never needing to swing it.  

Because once you swing, war begins.  

And war doesn’t take sides.  

It only takes.

Peace.
