When I was a child, I once asked my dad, "When is the best time to plant a tree?"  
He told me, "Twenty years ago."  

Back then, I could barely grasp the concepts of time and the significance of a tree.  
Yet, few had the foresight to plant a seed for the future, nurturing it with teamwork and innovation.  

Today, I am a leaf on that very tree.  

Happy 20th anniversary, [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) Hyderabad!  
And a heartfelt thank you to all those who paved the way.  

So guys, `the best time to plant a tree was indeed two decades ago. But the next best time is today.`  

Letâ€™s contribute our knowledge and experience, cultivating opportunities for those who will follow. To ensure that when the future someones look back, they will never regret missing the chance to sow progress.
